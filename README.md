# JavaPaint

**tldr:** A vector paint application built in Java for a software development assignment at QUT

**The Task:** "... to create a piece of Java software (from scratch) allowing for the 
preview of and editing of VEC files for the plotters. The idea is that this will allow designers to 
create their designs using a mouse in a WYSIWYG environment instead of messing around with graph paper 
and editing text files. Furthermore, the software must also be able to load our existing VEC files, 
view them and edit their contents (e.g. to touch up or add to an existing design.)"
